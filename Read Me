This is a set of python programs that will randomly play song on my Raspberry Pi Zero for my car stereo. I set up Samba share and rsync so I can sync songs to my car when ever it is within wireless range.
This is poorly written but does work well so far. I am running songs off a usb 2.0 flash drive and the pi zero runs about 40% cpu when playing a song and 4% idle while waiting for GPIO inputs. At some point I will write them all into one fancy program but this is working for me now.

With the files Startmusic.py, Stopmusic.py, Killomx.py, and Chelseastart.py running at startup via systemctl. I can press the GIPO button's
to start my Play list Startmusic.py or my fiances playlist Chelseastart.py.
